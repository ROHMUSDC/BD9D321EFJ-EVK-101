# BD9D321EFJ-EVK-101 Design Resource Repository
* Hardware Design Files and Documentation for the ROHM BD9D321EFJ-EVK-101 EVK

----
### Description: 
* BD9D321EFJ is a synchronous buck switching regulator with built-in low on-resistance power MOSFETs
* It is capable of providing current of up to 3 A
* The SLLM (TM) control provides excellent efficiency characteristics in light-load conditions which make the product appropriate for equipment and devices that demand minimal standby power consumption
* External phase compensation circuit is not necessary because this device uses a constant on-time control DC/DC converter with high speed response
